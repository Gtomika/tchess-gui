# TChess program with MFC GUI

As a school assignment to create a *GUI* application 
with *Microsoft Foundation Classes* I'm adding a GUI 
to my [console TChess application](https://github.com/Gtomika/tchess).

# Structure

In the root directory there are *MFC* related files, and in the 
*tchess* directory there are the files from the original 
TChess application, providing the chess logic.

# Download

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/Gtomika/tchess-gui/releases). 
Make sure to keep the *res* folder where the *exe* file is.

# How to build

This is a *Visual Studio* project, and should be imported 
and built there.

**Build variant:** Build the *Release* version, because the engine in the *Debug* version is VERY slow.
